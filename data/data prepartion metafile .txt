C. Description of Dataset 

This dataset is associated with an experiment that tests the effects of human activity and bear viewing on grizzly bear activity in the Khutze watershed. They also observed and noted the trade-off of risk avoidance and foraging associated with salmon levels. Wildlife avoids people and they wanted to highlight this through the bears from forty different cameras.  


D. Key to the dataset : 

Deployment - remote camera 
Detections - number of independent grizzly bears and that location
Treatment- whether tourism was open or closed
Week - week of the year 
Salmon Biomass - scaled biomass for the day 
Water level - water level in relation to grizzly bear fishing 
People previous - whether people were present the day previous 
People present - whether people were present that given day 
People - the number of people that were present 
Vessels- number of vessels that visited on a given day 
Tours- number of tours that visited on a given day 
Distance to tour- how far away the tour was to the camera
Year- the year 
Year Closures- whether the area was closed to tourism based on the year 
Days since people- the number of days since people visited 
Tour length- The number of hours in a day with people present 
Exposure- Whether the camera site was in a forested or open area
